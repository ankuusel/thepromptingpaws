# The Prompting Paws
## Whispers of Legacy 

Hello, World! But in a no-coding way...

If you are looking for some intricate code here, we're sorry to disappoint you. We are The Prompting Paws, a bear and a rabbit, and we dream of creating a project using Oracle Apex, Wand, and Buzzy.

However, as forest animals with paws, typing and coding is really challenging. We've tried our best, spent countless hours, and almost got some code running. Unfortunately, we faced too many errors and the hackathon time was running out.

So, we had to change our approach and decided to "Ship an awesome proof-of-concept with lots of potential" instead.

## Problem
Our world is a vibrant tapestry woven with over 7000 unique threads, each representing a distinct language, and with it, a rich cultural, historical, and diverse heritage. Yet, many of these threads are in danger of fraying and disappearing, especially those of minority communities. The resulting loss of knowledge, traditions, and unique perspectives poses a direct threat to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal #4 (SDG 4): Quality Education. This goal underscores the importance of inclusive and equitable quality education and the promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for all.

## Unique Value Proposition
Our solution ”Whispers of Legacy” offers a unique blend of AI technology and a community-oriented approach for preserving endangered languages. Whispers of Legacy provides an interactive, engaging, and accessible platform that serves as a comprehensive tool for both language preservation and learning. This offers a wide range of engaging, interactive learning resources tailored to different skill levels and learning styles. This includes interactive exercises, language games and virtual conversation practice with AI chatbots. The use of AI helps personalize the learning experience, adapting content and difficulty level based on learner’s progress.

So, what's Whispers of Legacy?
1. Collection of language data with Oracle Apex: Community members can contribute language data in various forms - text, audio, and video. This user-friendly interface ensures an authentic and diverse database, providing a rich pool of training data for our GPT model.
2. AI-Powered Data Analysis with Wand: The data collated via Oracle Apex is analyzed with the aid of Wand's Data Suggestions feature. This allows us to assess the quality of the data, rectify potential issues, and ensure a reliable and accurate resource for AI training and language learning.
3. Rapid Prototyping and Deployment with Buzzy: Buzzy's capabilities are harnessed to expedite the transformation of our concept into a fully-functional app. The resultant app will feature interactive learning modules, community forums for facilitating interaction between native speakers and learners, and resources for further learning and research.

Despite our challenges, we dream of creating a language preservation platform using these innovative low-code/no-code tools. 

A little forest humor for you: Why don't forest animals need to code? Because we have GPT to do it for us!

The bottom line: In the world of 1s and 0s, the most powerful tool is not having to code at all!

End of Python code, but the beginning of a no-code revolution!
